# Example Flask + Flask-Restless API

## Requirements

* Python 2.7.x or 3.5.x (later is probably OK)
* virtualenv

## Installation

1. Clone this repository and generate a fresh virtual environment:

    ```
    # replace <githost> with either github.com or github.uc.edu
    git clone git@<githost>:ernstki/flask-restless-demo-api.git
    cd flask-restless-demo-api

    # create a virtual environment, into which you'll install all the
    # dependencies for this project
    virtualenv venv

    # on Windows, do 'venv\scripts\activate.cmd' (I think)
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. Install necessary Python packages using `pip`:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Tell Flask where to find the app, initialize the `organism` database, and
   launch the Flask web application:

    ```
    # on Windows, do 'set FLASK_APP=demoapi\demoapi.py' (note the backslash)
    export FLASK_APP=demoapi/demoapi.py
    flask initdb
    flask run  # defaults to http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```

    If you install [autoenv] on a Unix system (OS X / macOS is Unix), you don't
    have to set `FLASK_APP`, it's done for you automatically when you enter the
    directory.

    If you're running the Flask application within a VirtualBox VM, you'll want
    to be sure that the app runs on 0.0.0.0, so that the VirtualBox port
    forwarding works correctly. You can launch the app with command line flags
    to achieve that:

    ```
    flask run --host=0.0.0.0  # optionally: --port=5000
    ```

## Other tips


### Testing the API with [Postman][]

You can use [Postman][] to test requests to the API. The included
`postman_collection.json` may be imported through the Postman user interface,
and includes two example queries.

### Using MySQL instead of SQLite

Out of the box, this Flask app is set up to use a SQLite3 database in the
named `organism.db` in the current working directory, but with slight
modifications, you can use a MySQL database instead. (Check out the comments
in `config.py`.)

The two `.sql` files are provided so that you can feed them into either
`mysql` or `sqlite3` at the command line to create the table schema and insert
the default values. Here's a sample invocation for SQLite:

```
sqlite3 organism.db < organism_table_sqlite3.sql
```

Thanks to Andrey Lando for helping jog my brain about some SQL query stuff that
one time. Credit to Tchibo [Black 'N White][tchibo] for supporting the initial
iteration of this project, caffeine-wise.
